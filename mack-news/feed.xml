The one-year contract, which runs to January 2021, includes two additional GSA-optioned one-year extensions, which could push the contract through 2022. “With this contract in place, fleet managers in more than 300 federal agencies have a one-stop shop where they can select commercial Mack vehicles and parts to address their needs,” said Nicole Zelno, Mack Defense senior manager, contracts and bid/orders. “We look forward to working with the GSA to fulfill our contract with durable, reliable Mack trucks, all of which are assembled here in the U.S.A.” Mack Defense has been a GSA contract holder since 2015 and has supplied various federal government agencies with Mack Trucks products as part of these contracts.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ALLENTOWN, PA (June 1, 2020) – Mack Defense has selected Hutchinson Industries Inc. as the provider of complete wheel assemblies, beadlocks and thermal hub covers for the Mack Defense M917A3 heavy dump truck (HDT). “Wheeled military vehicles like the M917A3 require specialized protection to help maintain mobility in harsh operating environments,” said David Hartzell, president, Mack Defense. “Mack Defense chose Hutchinson to help make sure the M917A3 is equipped with the right components to get the job done.” Founded in 1853, Hutchinson Industries Inc. is one of the world’s oldest rubber product manufacturers and is the premier manufacturer of engineered mobility solutions for wheeled and tracked military, security, off-road, commercial and industrial vehicles. “We are thrilled to provide products that meet the demanding payload and mobility requirements set by the U.S. Army HDT program,” said Andy Barker, Hutchinson CEO. “It is our mission, and an honor, to develop products and provide the support that allows our soldiers to complete the mission and return safely to base.” Hutchinson representatives were on hand to celebrate the official handover of the first five Mack Defense M917A3 HDTs to the U.S. Army during a ceremony at the Mack Customer Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 2019. The five vehicles will undergo 40 weeks of production verification testing at the U.S. Army’s Aberdeen test center in Maryland. The Mack Defense M917A3 HDT is based on the civilian Mack® Granite® model, one of the top-selling construction trucks in North America. To meet the demanding needs of the U.S. Army, Mack Defense added heavier-duty rear axles, all-wheel drive, increased suspension ride height and other features. The new HDTs will help increase the U.S. Army's operational effectiveness and readiness, while supporting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability and sustainment operations for the Joint Force. The U.S. Army awarded Mack Defense a $296 million contract in May 2018 to produce up to 683 M917A3 HDTs.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ALLENTOWN, PA (Feb. 17, 2020) – Mack Defense has selected XMCO INC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Koniag Government Services (KGS), as the Integrated Product Support (IPS) partner for the U.S. Army M917A3 Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) contract. In this capacity, XMCO is responsible for the preparation of all IPS deliverables required to support testing and full materiel release of the system to the U.S. Army. “Building a reliable, durable and robust vehicle platform to the U.S. Army’s specifications was only part of the total package requirement to which Mack Defense had to respond,” said David Hartzell, president, Mack Defense. “Finding an IPS provider with a proven track record for on-time quality services was critical, since all IPS product data must be completed in military standard (MIL-STD) format before vehicles will be accepted by the Army and turned over to the user community.” XMCO has a long history of developing, validating and verifying all support documents, such as Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs), training materials, provisioning documentation, Level of Repair Analyses (LORA) and other logistics product data that will pass rigorous government inspection. XMCO has more than 40 years of experience in this business sector, most of which includes being a supplier to OEMs, as well as to the Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) community, making XMCO a perfect fit for the Mack Defense HDT team. “XMCO is excited and honored to be selected by the Mack Defense HDT team as a program partner,” said Linda Czajka, KGS ILS Operating Group president. “We believe our very targeted experience – on truck platforms in particular – will be a major benefit to the success of the IPS program for the M917A3.” XMCO has been provided an M917A3 truck for the sole purpose of logistics data development. Having the vehicle on site at XMCO’s facility allows technical writers, illustrators and provisioning specialists the opportunity to prepare their products with “hands-on” access which contributes significantly to technical and graphic accuracy. Mack Defense has been proactive in integrating the XMCO IPS team with their HDT technical team to ensure the groups are operating as a cohesive unit, thus contributing to high quality, technically accurate logistics data products.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[GREENSBORO, NC (May 28, 2020) – To assist those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Mack Trucks and the American Trucking Associations (ATA) are partnering with the American Logistics Aid Network (ALAN) to deliver vital supplies, such as food and personal-care items, to nonprofit organizations who distribute these goods locally. “In good times and bad, the trucking industry moves nearly three-quarters of our nation’s freight, helping ensure crucial supplies are delivered where they are needed,” said Martin Weissburg, president, Mack Trucks. “Working in partnership with ATA and ALAN enables us to more effectively marshal resources and deliver supplies to organizations addressing the needs of local communities across the country.” Two model year 2019 Mack Anthem® models, which Mack provided to the ATA as part of its sponsorship of the Share the Road and Workforce Heroes programs, are now delivering shipments of supplies between nonprofit organizations, including Feed the Children and Joshua’s Heart Foundation, among others. Professional truck drivers from ATA member companies have volunteered their time to make the deliveries. Since the ATA’s Share the Road and Workforce Heroes live safety and career education efforts have been postponed or cancelled due to shelter-in-place requirements and other safety precautions, Mack and ATA released both Anthem models to make deliveries coordinated through ALAN. “Given all of the supply chain chaos surrounding COVID-19, it would have been easy for these organizations to press the pause button on their charitable program until the crisis was past,” said Kathy Fulton, ALAN’s executive director. “But we’re so thankful they didn’t, because trucking is always one of our non-profit partners’ biggest needs. And these vehicles are allowing us to support many relief efforts in a really big way.” The partnership between the ATA and ALAN traces back several years and through several natural disasters. ALAN, which was founded in 2005, provides supplychain assistance to disaster relief organizations and other non-profits by connecting them with transportation resources during a crisis. In addition to connecting non-profits in need with transportation solutions, ALAN helps humanitarian organizations make every logistics dollar count. “ATA’s relationship with ALAN dates to their creation, following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005,” said Elisabeth Barna, executive vice president, industry affairs, ATA. “At that time, our Share the Road Mack® Pinnacle™ axle back model made its maiden voyage to New Orleans with a truckload of water.” ALAN was contacted in April by Feed the Children, a leading hunger relief organization fighting to end childhood hunger by distributing food and other essentials for daily living through its network of community partners across the country. As the response to the coronavirus pandemic began impacting traditional distribution efforts, Feed the Children began looking for solutions to ensure its tens of thousands of pounds of food and beverages, personal care items and laundry detergent located in its LaVergne, Tennessee warehouse made its way swiftly to non-profit partners around the country. It was critical to them to make sure the ever-growing needs of those affected by the pandemic could be met. One of those community partners is the Miami, Florida-based Joshua’s Heart Foundation. Founded in 2005 by a then 4-year-old Joshua Williams, the organization is dedicated to the fight against global hunger and poverty. “Our mission is to empower needy people to improve their quality of life by providing them necessities like groceries and personal items,” said Williams, Joshua’s Heart Foundation founder and chief changemaker. “Like all organizations, the pandemic has affected our ability to receive and distribute goods, making the shipments from Feed the Children through ALAN critical to our efforts.” Mack and ATA will continue to coordinate transport solutions with ALAN until demand subsides.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[GREENSBORO, NC (April 28, 2020) – Mack Trucks today launched free 90-day access to eLearning courses for high school and secondary technical education students interested in becoming a diesel technician, but who cannot attend in-person hands-on training because of the COVID-19 situation. The courses, provided to students through their local Mack dealer, will provide an option for training typically done in a classroom. With recent mandates for self-isolation and social distancing, training for these students had been temporarily postponed. “Recognizing that it’s impossible for students to train in person at this time, the Mack Trucks Academy decided to work with Mack dealers to offer online training that is comprehensive,” said Scott Behe, Mack Trucks Academy senior manager for training support. “The online courses will help fill the gap until we can go back to a more normal situation.” The Mack Trucks Academy will offer free 90-day access to a portion of the Technical Education Support (TES) online training and resources currently offered to diesel technicians. TES90 Access will be limited for high school students and secondary technical education students to training sessions such as engines, transmissions and vendor components, among others. The dealer will provide access to the training content and will communicate the availability of online training to the schools, with which they already have relationships. Schools will enroll through their local dealer. “Diesel technicians are critical to the uptime of heavy-duty trucks, so we are pleased to offer a program that will make training available for those interested in a career as a technician trained on Mack truck models,” Behe said. Offering online training is just one area in which Mack Trucks has offered help during COVID-19. Mack Trucks recently launched info.macktrucks.com/thankyou, an online resource offering dealers and trucking companies useful information from government agencies and other sources, along with Mack-specific updates regarding ongoing 24/7 customer support from Mack® OneCall™ agents, parts availability, production and a link to dealer locations. The dedicated webpage also features a video expressing Mack’s gratitude for the tireless efforts of truck customers, professional drivers, service technicians and dealers during these difficult times, as well as links to the #thankatrucker conversation on social media.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[GREENSBORO, NC (May 14, 2020) – Mack Certified Uptime Dealers are creating new procedures to help ensure the safety of employees and customers requiring service and support during COVID-19. “It’s imperative that dealer employees and customers maintain their health and safety at all times, but especially during the current situation,” said David Pardue, Mack vice president of connected vehicle and uptime services. “Many of our dealers, and especially Mack Certified Uptime Dealers, have taken extra precautions to develop best practices and new ways of working to help reduce exposure risks.” Vision Truck Group, based in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, and TranSource, in Colfax, North Carolina, are two such dealers. Both sites are Mack Certified Uptime Dealers, which distinguishes them as having met stringent requirements to improve customer service. Repairs are quicker because of standardized workflows and redesigned service bays reserved specifically for trucks requiring less than four hours of work for service and repair. Along with social distancing, workplace and vehicle disinfection, staggered work shifts, adjusted break and lunch times, usages of mask, gloves and disinfectants and hand sanitizer, Vision Truck Group moved to a paperless operation, minimizing face-toface interaction while still enabling efficiency by utilizing Mack® ASIST, Mack’s webbased service management system. “The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges of social distancing in our industry,” said John Slotegraaf, president of Vision Truck Group. “Vision already had some processes in place, including creating a paperless operation in 2019, offering a strong response to minimize exposure risk.” No paper is passed throughout the site. Rather, teams communicate via ASIST, allowing technicians to receive and view work assignments on their iPads, while also allowing fleet managers complete visibility into the work being completed. Vision sites also feature enhanced automation, including motion-activated lighting, faucets, toilets, hand dryers, water fountains and doors, enabling employees and customers to avoid contact with typically highly touched areas. TranSource also has made changes as a result of the COVID-19 situation, offering pickup and delivery services to assist customers who are working with reduced staff. “Many of our customers may need service but do not have the personnel available to bring the truck into our dealership,” said Jason Lucero, service director at TranSouce. “Recognizing this, we are offering them an option to have a CDL driver transport their truck should they need it.” TranSource is also increasing training for its staff at this time and making sure any customers with vehicles affected by open campaigns or recalls are contacted to make sure their vehicle is addressed. Results show that at the 156 Mack Certified Uptime Dealers, shop efficiency increased by 24 percent, check-in time was reduced by more than 40 minutes and diagnostic times decreased by 70 percent. Mack’s Uptime Solutions, including Mack GuardDog® Connect telematics and Mack ASIST service management system, are built into the Mack Certified Uptime Dealers’ workflows. Also to assist during COVID-19, Mack recently launched info.macktrucks.com/thankyou, an online resource offering useful information from government agencies and other key sources, to help trucking companies and dealers. The dedicated webpage also offers Mack-specific updates regarding customer support, parts availability, production and a link to dealer locations.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ALLENTOWN, PA (June 25, 2020) – To better serve customers, as well as enhance its capability to support military and government contracts, Mack Defense has relocated its headquarters to the Mack Customer Center (MCC) located in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The move, which was recently completed, also provides Mack Defense additional working space and access to other MCC amenities. “The Mack Customer Center is an outstanding facility and presents our company and the Mack brand in a way we could not replicate at our previous location,” said David Hartzell, president, Mack Defense. “We have easier access to a number of unique features at the MCC, such as the test track and industrial space, while still retaining the robust security requirements that are required when working on military contracts.” Military and government contracts often include classified information, which requires additional security measures. Mack Defense worked with the U.S. Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) and the MCC facility team to ensure the required physical and technological security requirement are in place. In addition to meeting security needs, the new space also offers prospective customers a more complete representation of Mack Defense and its capabilities. “When hosting current and prospective customers, the MCC facility paints a completely different picture than our previous location, demonstrating the wide range of solutions we can offer our customers,” said Hartzell. Mack Defense’s move was timed specifically to utilize the enhanced capabilities available at the MCC to support the current active contract with the U.S. Army to provide heavy dump trucks. Mack Defense was awarded a firm-fixed-price $296 million contract in May 2018 from the U.S. Army to produce up to 683 M917A3 Heavy Dump Trucks (HDT).]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[GREENSBORO, NC (May 20, 2020) – The seventh episode of Mack Trucks’ RoadLife 2.0 series, available on roadlife.tv, debuted today featuring Reliant Holdings, Ltd. Reliant Holdings supplies liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) and dry ice to a variety of industries using the Mack Anthem® model to safely and efficiently deliver its products. “My father bought some ranching property in New Mexico, and underneath that property was one of the largest naturally occurring sources of CO2 in the country,” said Vance Vanderburg, chief operating officer, Reliant Holdings, Ltd. “Today, under the umbrella of Reliant Holdings, we have a number of profit centers that deliver CO2 products.” Reliant Holdings, founded in 1989, provides liquid CO2 to a wide range of industries, including restaurants and convenience stores for their beverage systems, and bulk quantities for food processing and beverage bottling plants. The company also provides CO2 to oil and gas well operators for use in enhanced oil recovery projects. With oil and gas customers located across western Texas and eastern New Mexico, Reliant Holdings needed trucks that could withstand the unimproved roads commonly found in oil patches. “Up to 95 percent of our trucks’ lives can be on an unpaved road, and with our Mack trucks, it’s unbelievable how much better they’ve done in that environment,” Vanderburg said. “They hold up better, and you can bring one out of that environment, put it back on-highway and still get a useful life out of it.” Safety is a core value of Reliant Holdings, and the Mack Anthem model delivers with a number of standard and available features. “Safety features added to the Mack Anthem are really starting to attract fleets,” said Don Freeman, sales manager, Bruckner Truck Sales. “They’re needed not only to protect drivers, but also to meet increasing insurance demands.” Mack Anthem models come standard with Mack Road Stability Advantage by Bendix, a fully electronic stability control system designed to help mitigate the chances of a rollover or jackknife incident, and Bendix Wingman Fusion, a camera- and radarbased system that provides collision mitigation, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning capabilities. “When we go to renew our insurance, and we tell them what kind of truck we’re spec-ing out, we’re going to get a discount,” said Vanderburg. “If you spend a little more for safety equipment in a truck, it’s going to pay you back.” Additional RoadLife 2.0 episodes will premiere throughout the summer. Viewers can watch RoadLife episodes on roadlife.tv and Amazon Prime Video, with additional content featured on Mack Trucks’ social channels: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ALLENTOWN, PA (Feb. 13, 2020) – Mack Defense has assembled the 1,587th and final truck for the Medium Support Vehicle System (MSVS) Standard Military Pattern (SMP) program. The truck rolled off the assembly line on Feb. 13 in Saint Nicolas, Quebec in front of a select group of dignitaries, military officials and Mack Defense employees. “Mack Defense is proud to have completed the build out of these trucks, and we look forward to continuing the program and supporting the more than 1,500 MSVS trucks that will be in service with the Canadian Armed Forces,” said David Hartzell, president, Mack Defense. “This program demonstrates the global reach and collaboration Mack Defense is capable of.” Mack Defense is part of the Volvo Group and leveraged the Group’s large industrial footprint and global capabilities to engineer and produce the MSVS SMP trucks. Before final production took place at a Prevost facility in Saint Nicolas, additional work was completed at facilities located in Bourg-en-Bresse, Marolles, Blainville and Limoges, France. The MSVS SMP program was coordinated through Mack Defense headquarters in Allentown, Pennsylvania. In addition, Mack Defense called upon several key Canadian partners including Dumur Industries Ltd., EODC, Inc., Marshall, Craig Manufacturing and Link Suspensions of Canada (Raydan Division) to contribute to the project. Mack Defense was awarded two contracts in 2015 valued at $725 million CAD by the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada on behalf of the Department of National Defense. The contracts called for Mack Defense to deliver more than 1,500 8x8 MSVS SMP trucks, including variants such as cargo, material handling cranes, load handling systems (LHS) and mobile repair trucks (MRT).]]></content>

This feature will be available in the fourth quarter of 2020. For more information about the GuardDog Connect extension, please contact your local Mack dealer.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[INDIANAPOLIS (March 4, 2020) – Mack Trucks unveiled to the public for the first time its highly anticipated all-new Mack® MD Series of medium-duty trucks during the Work Truck Show March 3-6 at the Indiana Convention Center, Indianapolis. The Mack MD Series includes a Class 6 and Class 7 model, both of which are exempt from the 12 percent Federal Excise Tax (FET). The Mack MD6, a Class 6 model, has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 25,995 pounds, and the MD7, a Class 7 model, has a GVWR of 33,000 pounds. “Mack is extremely proud to reach even more customers through our medium duty Mack MD6 and MD7 models,” said Jonathan Randall, Mack Trucks senior vice president of North American sales and marketing. “With these trucks, Mack now offers a complete lineup of Class 6 to 8 vehicles, and the Mack MD Series will enable us to meet the needs of those customers desiring Mack’s legendary durability in a lighter weight GVWR configuration.” The Mack MD6 and MD7 models, available in 4x2 configurations, are ideal for dry van/refrigerated, tank truck, dump, stake and flatbed applications. A Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) is not required to operate the MD6 model as long as the payload is non-hazardous. The driver-focused interior of the Mack MD6 and MD7 models incorporate comfortable and ergonomic design features from Mack’s Class 8 truck models, ensuring a quiet ride for drivers. Offering a sharp wheel cut for enhanced maneuverability in tough urban settings, the all-new cab of the MD6 and MD7 models feature an industry-best short bumper-to-back-of-cab (BBC) measurement of 103 inches. The MD Series also offers a clear back of cab and top of frame rail to make it easier for body builder adaptations. Eight wheelbase lengths are offered with the Mack MD Series, supporting typical bodies ranging from 10 to 26 feet. The vehicles come standard with 22.5-inch wheels or optional 19.5-inch wheels. The exterior of the medium-duty models was inspired by the Mack Anthem®, Mack’s highway model, matching its bold look and styling through the grille and hood design. The Mack MD Series will be supported through Geotab Go offering access to Mack OneCall™ agents, available 24/7 at the Mack Uptime Center based in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Mack MD Series will be assembled at the Roanoke Valley Operations in Roanoke Valley, Virginia. Serial production begins in July. Customers interested in the Mack MD Series can visit Mack booth No. 3523 at the Work Truck Show 2020 at the Indiana Convention Center, their local Mack dealer or www.macktrucks.com.]]></content>

A highly advanced active steering system, Mack Command Steer adds an electric motor to the existing hydraulic steering to help reduce driver effort up to 85 percent and improve driver productivity and comfort.| “Even with the all-day comfort provided by the Mack Anthem model’s ergonomic interior, driving a heavy-duty truck remains a highly physical task,” said Stu Russoli, Mack highway product manager. “With Mack Command Steer, we’re helping reduce driver fatigue and muscle strain by up to 30 percent, improving safety and productivity as well as helping to protect the truck’s most valuable asset: the driver.” Mack Command Steer provides variable steering assist based on the driving situation. Multiple sensors throughout the truck monitor road conditions, driver inputs and even environmental elements, and relay those observations more than 2,000 times per second. The system’s electric motor then applies additional torque as needed to the steering, making it easier to keep the truck on the desired path. “The additional torque, or steering force, provided by Mack Command Steer means drivers no longer have to ‘fight the wheel’ while driving on poor roads or in difficult weather conditions,” Russoli said. “This helps drivers maintain greater control and keep their focus on what’s ahead, enhancing safety for everyone on the road.” Even in normal driving situations, Mack Command Steer helps suppress road disturbances such as potholes or other surface irregularities, smoothing the steering feedback and reducing the possibility of steering wheel “kicks.”]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ALLENTOWN, PA (May 26, 2020) – In response to sustained demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) as a result of COVID-19, Mack Trucks donated about 500 pieces of PPE that it manufactured at its Lehigh Valley Operations (LVO) plant in Macungie, Pennsylvania. “The Mack team is committed to doing what we can to help the communities in which we live and work, and I’m very proud of our LVO employees for stepping up to produce PPE during the coronavirus pandemic,” said Rickard Lundberg, vice president and general manager at LVO. “For nearly 120 years, Mack has risen to the challenge of fulfilling vital needs, most recently through the production of PPE.” Mack engineers and leadership reviewed several different design possibilities before deciding upon the production of face shield headbands utilizing its 3D printer, as well as hand-crafted assembly at LVO, where all Mack Class 8 vehicles for North America and export are built. Mack first produced PPE for employees and has since donated about 500 pieces to various organizations, including Lehigh Valley Health Network, Lehigh Center, Kirkland Village, Westminister Village and The Easton Home. Mack will donate more as the PPE pieces are produced, based on demand in the community. Mack also recently began producing 3D-printed ear guards to offer additional comfort to employees wearing face masks. Earlier this spring, Mack donated other PPE, including masks, gloves and safety goggles, to St. Luke’s University Health Network, South Mountain Memory Care, Success Rehabilitation and Maxim Healthcare Services. PPE production is just one way that Mack is helping the community. Mack recently donated $10,000 to the Second Harvest Food Bank of the Lehigh Valley and Northeast Pennsylvania to help those with food insecurity. Second Harvest Food Bank of the Lehigh Valley and Northeast Pennsylvania serves 200 agencies in Carbon, Lehigh, Monroe, Northampton, Pike and Wayne counties. Its mission is to “obtain food and distribute it to people in need through area non-profits, and to provide resources for education and advocacy to end hunger.” The organization was started in 1982. Second Harvest delivered 9.4 million pounds of food during fiscal year 2018-2019. “The Lehigh Valley community is very important to Mack Trucks,” Lundberg said. “We are doing what we can to support it in meaningful ways so that those most in need are supported.”]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[GREENSBORO, NC (June 10, 2020) – Mack Trucks, the “Official Hauler of NASCAR,” recently hosted several of NASCAR’s Mack Anthem® haulers at its world headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina as part of its #thankatrucker campaign to recognize truckers for their hard work during the coronavirus pandemic. “We were grateful to have our NASCAR partners on campus today to help say ‘thank you’ to the men and women of the trucking industry,’ said John Walsh, Mack Trucks vice president of marketing. “We recognize the sacrifices they’ve made to keep goods on our shelves and critical supplies moving throughout the coronavirus pandemic.” The visit was just one part of a day-long effort by Mack and NASCAR to thank critical workers. From Greensboro, the haulers traveled to Martinsville, Virginia-based Sovah Health to thank the frontline workers at the hospital and deliver special Mackbranded merchandise, including hats, ear buds and hand sanitizer. NASCAR’s haulers are in the region in preparation for the NASCAR Cup Series race at Martinsville Speedway today. In its role as the “Official Hauler of NASCAR,” Mack provides a fleet of Mack Anthem 70-inch stand-up sleeper models custom-designed to meet haul critical race technology and equipment from race to race throughout the grueling NASCAR season. The NASCAR Mack Anthem models are equipped with a 505-horsepower Mack MP®8 engine and a Mack mDRIVE™ automated manual transmission. Also standard is Mack GuardDog® Connect, an uptime solutions service that proactively monitors the truck to help prevent unplanned downtime events. Mack Trucks also provides transportation for Richard Petty Motorsports’ race team featuring the legendary number 43 racecar driven by Darrell “Bubba” Wallace Jr. Mack’s efforts supporting NASCAR and Richard Petty Motorsports were featured in “New Blood,” an episode from season one of Mack’s RoadLife video series. The episode focuses on the extreme coordination required to keep NASCAR racing, including interviews with Petty, Wallace and veteran hauler drivers. The episode is available at https://roadlife.tv.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS – (Jan. 22, 2019) – Mack Trucks will offer the Mack® mDRIVE™ HD automated manual transmission (AMT) in Mack TerraPro® concrete pumper models beginning in 2019, marking the first time in the industry that an AMT has been available in a cabover concrete pumper. The fully integrated 13- and 14-speed mDRIVE HD AMTs give concrete pumper customers improved performance, proven durability and maximized uptime in an easy-to-operate package. Mack made the announcement at World of Concrete 2019 in Las Vegas. “The mDRIVE HD is the only AMT available with split-shaft PTO functionality, which enables us to offer concrete pumper customers all the benefits of the mDRIVE HD and our fully integrated powertrain,” said John Walsh, vice president of marketing for Mack Trucks. “In addition to improved performance and productivity, the mDRIVE HD helps increase jobsite safety. Eliminating traditional shifting allows drivers to focus on safely operating their equipment.” All Mack mDRIVE HD AMTs come standard with split-shaft PTO functionality. Instead of taking power from a transmission- or engine-mounted PTO, split-shaft PTOs receive output directly from the transmission, supplying higher torque for large auxiliary equipment including concrete pumps. The Mack mDRIVE HD is fully integrated with Mack’s legendary engines and axles, providing additional performance and efficiency benefits for customers. In TerraPro concrete pumpers, the mDRIVE HD will be paired exclusively with the 11-liter Mack MP®7 engine, and will be available with higher horsepower and torque ratings than equivalent models with conventional automatic transmissions. That includes the MP7’s top rating of 425 horsepower and 1,560 lb.-ft. of torque, which packs 13-liter power in an 11-liter engine. The mDRIVE HD for TerraPro concrete pumper models is available as a 13-speed direct drive or overdrive, as well as a 14-speed direct drive.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[GREENSBORO, NC (April 1, 2019) – For the next year, two customers operating Mack Anthem® models will track their fuel savings efforts and share their experiences. Jamie Hagen, owner of Stratford, South Dakota-based Hell Bent Xpress, LLC, and Joel Morrow, senior driver and vice president for fleet equipment procurement at Ploger Transportation based in Norwalk, Ohio will capture and communicate data using the hashtag #Mackonomics. “Fuel costs are one of the largest expenses customers incur,” said John Walsh, Mack Trucks vice president of marketing. “We’ve proven the fuel efficiency of the new Mack Anthem in road tests during development of the product. Now customers are experiencing #Mackonomics in their own over-the-road operations.” Throughout the year, both Hagen and Morrow will track their loads, driving distances, routes, weather and more in evaluating how their Mack Anthem models stack up on fuel efficiency. Hagen (Twitter) and Morrow (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) will regularly post updates, videos and other content to show just how much #Mackonomics is saving their operations and improving total cost of ownership. Content from Hagen and Morrow also will be featured on Mack’s social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube). “We typically run food-grade tankers, so we’re loaded on the way out and empty on the return,” Hagen said. “We added the Mack® 6x2 with Liftable Pusher Axle to enable us to save even more during those empty or lightly loaded trips.” Morrow and Ploger Transportation, a truckload carrier, are no strangers to chasing fuel efficiency advantages and have a long history of pushing the envelope to find additional savings. “We’ve been optimizing our fleet for fuel efficiency for a number of years, including adopting 11-liter engines when everyone said we needed a 13-liter,” said Morrow. “Now, with the Mack MP8®HE and its Energy Recovery Technology, we’re able to have the best of both worlds: power without sacrificing fuel efficiency.” Both Mack Anthem models are spec’d with Mack’s HE+ efficiency package, which combines the 13-liter Mack MP8HE engine with Mack Energy Recovery Technology, along with several aerodynamic and efficiency enhancements to deliver up to 9.5 percent improvement in fuel efficiency. Mack Energy Recovery Technology captures energy from the engine’s exhaust that would otherwise be wasted and converts it to mechanical energy fed back to the engine crankshaft as additional torque. This extra energy helps relax the engine and improve fuel efficiency. The Mack HE+ package is available exclusively with the Mack mDRIVE™ automated manual transmission, which is fully integrated with the Mack MP8HE. The Mack mDRIVE constantly monitors speed, grade, load and other variables to identify ideal shift points and help ensure the truck is always in the right gear and delivering maximum efficiency. The mDRIVE also enables a lower, downsped cruise RPM to take advantage of the extra torque provided by Mack Energy Recovery Technology. The Mack HE+ package also includes Mack Predictive Cruise, an intelligent system that allows the mDRIVE to memorize routes when cruise control is active, storing up to 4,500 hills in its memory. On subsequent trips on the same route, Mack Predictive Cruise engages the ideal shift strategy for maximum fuel efficiency.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS (Jan. 22, 2019) – Mack Trucks today announced a new loyalty reward program for members of eligible industry associations who purchase model year 2019 and 2020 Mack® Granite®, TerraPro™, LR, Pinnacle™ or Mack Anthem® models. Mack made the announcement during World of Concrete 2019, Jan. 22-25 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada. The Loyalty Reward Card Program offers members of eligible industry associations a $2,000 parts and service reward card per eligible VIN and a maximum of five trucks per member, per calendar year. All eligible vehicles must be sold and warranty-registered by Dec. 31, 2019. “We recognize that customers require service and support after the initial truck purchase, so we’re pleased that Mack can offer the Loyalty Reward Card Program to help offset some of the cost, while improving customers’ total cost of ownership,” said Jonathan Randall, Mack Trucks senior vice president, North American sales and marketing. “The Loyalty Reward Card is another example of Mack’s dedication to service, support and having our customers’ backs.” The registered owner of the truck must be an active member of an eligible association prior to the date of truck purchase. Once verified, the member will receive the card within eight weeks. To see which associations qualify, please visit your local Mack dealer. For more information, please visit Mack booth No. C5103 at World of Concrete 2019 or your local Mack dealer.]]></content>

Mack Trucks dealer Vision Truck Group in Cambridge, Ontario provided the truck, which was driven by members of the Owner-Operators Business Association of Canada (OBAC) and raised $3,340 CAD in the fight against breast cancer. “Vision Truck Group was honored to provide a Mack Anthem model to the OBAC team for such a worthwhile cause,” said John Baker, director of sales, Vision Truck Group. “It was great to see supporters rally around the Anthem and pledge their support to help find a cure.” “Trucking For a Cure” not only raises funds for breast cancer research, but also helps build bridges between commercial drivers, the trucking industry and the public to raise awareness among trucking enthusiasts around the fight against breast cancer. Two convoys are held each year in Woodstock and Prescott, Ontario. With nearly 130 trucks participating in this year’s events, “Trucking For a Cure” raised more than $114,500 CAD.]]></content>
